## **Implemented Features**  

### **Al Saihan Tajvi**  
- Displaying a command prompt (e.g., `sh>`) and reading user input.  
- Parsing and executing system commands using `fork()` and `exec()`.  
- Supporting multiple in-line commands separated by semicolons (`;`).  
- Supporting sequential command execution using logical AND (`&&`).  

### **Farhan Zarif**  
- Implementing input (`<`) and output (`>`, `>>`) redirection using `dup()` and `dup2()`.  
- Enabling command piping (`|`) for any number of pipes.  

### **Sadik Mina Dweep**  
- Signal handling (`CTRL+C`) using `signal()` and `sigaction()` to terminate running commands without exiting the shell.  
- Maintaining and supporting a history of executed commands.
